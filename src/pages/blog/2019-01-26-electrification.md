  The SIGHT chapter of IEEE SB TKMCE and EEE Department joined hands with KSEB
  to provide electricity for a community hall located in a sparsely populated
  remote village in the outskirts of Kollam. The locality mainly consisted of
  daily wage workers who toil day and night to meet both ends .the village is
  devoid of good transportation facility, healthcare facility and even proper
  schools. The aim of the project was to electrify the community hall, which
  serves many purposes. The students were taken to the destination 86kms from
  Kollam town and were accompanied by KSEB employees, wire-men and line-men.
