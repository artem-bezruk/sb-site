Women of the World presented Arya Murali in APJ Hall and Sajna Ali in the College auditorium brimming with stacks of queued up stories with the fire to inspire anyone and everyone. 
Arya Murali, Co-founder of the online community - The Rethink Foundation - paved her way to the heart of the audience by putting forth an exhilarating narration of events that steered her life through all the seemingly impossible ways.

The complexity of her simplicity is well evident in the dynamic work that she undertakes.
